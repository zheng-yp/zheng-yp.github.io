## About Me

I received my Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence at Renmin University of China in June 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhewei Wei](https://weizhewei.com/). Before that, I received my master's degree of engineering from Beijing Technology and Business University in June 2020.

I was a visiting scientist from March 2023 to September 2023 in CSIRO, DATA61, advised by [Prof. Jiajun Liu](https://people.csiro.au/L/J/ryan-liu).



## Research Interests

My research focuses on graph and learning algorithms. I am particularly interested in efficient algorithms on Graph Neural Networks, Dynamic Graph Representation Learning.
